## Abstract
We present the first comprehensive Lean 4 formalization of statistical learning theory (SLT) grounded in empirical process theory. Our end-to-end formal infrastructure implement the missing contents in latest Lean library, including a complete development of Gaussian Lipschitz concentration, the first formalization of Dudley’s entropy integral theorem for sub-Gaussian processes, and an application to least-squares regression with a sharp rate. The project was carried out using a human–AI collaborative workflow, in which humans design proof strategies and AI agents execute tactical proof construction, resulting in approximately 30,000 lines of human-verified Lean 4 code produced over 500 hours of supervised development. Beyond implementation, the formalization process exposes and resolves implicit assumptions and missing details in standard SLT textbooks, enforcing a granular, line-by-line understanding of the theory. This work establishes a reusable formal foundation for future developments in machine learning theory.

## Dataset

We release a high-quality Lean 4 training dataset for LLM's formal reasoning — 865 traced theorems, 18,669 tactic steps, 300M tokens from our SLT library. Every proof is human-verified, non-LLM-synthetic with full proof state traces (state_before → tactic → state_after).

- **Novel**: Validation and test sets contain theorems that use premises not seen during training (harder evaluation).
- **Random**: Theorems are split randomly.
- **Corpus**: 3,021 premises across 470 files (SLT library + referenced Mathlib/Lean4 stdlib declarations). Used for retrieval-augmented proving.

## Recipe for Vibe Formalization

We provide a practical recipe for human–AI collaborative formalization in Lean 4, distilled from our experience producing ~30,000 lines of human-verified code with Claude Code (`Claude-Opus-4.5`). The full guide and example prompts live in [`vibe-recipe/`](./vibe-recipe/).

**Workflow at a glance.** The process follows four iterative steps:

1. **Decompose proofs into small lemmas.** We recommend to ensure the target to formalize can be finished within a single agent context window (~300 lines) without auto-compaction. Small units increase the agent's effective thinking budget, reduce the information loss of context compaction.

2. **Design high-quality prompts.** Supply the agent with (a) signatures of possibly-needed project-local declarations obtained via the file outline MCP tool—*never* full file contents, which quickly fill the context window and cause hallucinations—and (b) a well-written mathematical proof to formalize. Mathlib declarations can be discovered on-the-fly through Lean search MCP tools. A worked example is given in [`vibe-recipe/EXAMPLE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](./vibe-recipe/EXAMPLE_INSTRUCTIONS.md).

3. **Clean compiler warnings.** Instruct the agent to eliminate all warnings, explicitly directing it to *remove* unused variables rather than masking them with `_` (a harmful preference of `Claude-Opus-4.5`).

4. **Clean unused `have` statements.** Use the custom `#check_unused_have` metaprogram ([`vibe-recipe/UnusedHaveDetector.lean`](./vibe-recipe/UnusedHaveDetector.lean)) to detect and remove dead `have` bindings from proof terms. Repeat Steps 3–4 until both are clean.

**Human-in-the-loop intervention.** A recurring failure mode we observe is that when the agent faces many simultaneous tactic errors in a long proof, it tends to abandon a largely correct proof structure in favor of drastic—and often incorrect—rewrites (e.g., *"Let me simplify the approach…"*). To counteract this, we instruct to encourage the agent always to fix errors first. This forces incremental error resolution, which surfaces structurally diagnostic errors that expose the true root cause rather than triggering wholesale re-proofs.
